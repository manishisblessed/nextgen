 * Canonical list of documents an onboardee MUST upload before their invite can

 *   - the server-side registration gate (`.../register/route.ts`).
 *
 * Keep the two in sync via this module so the client and server can never drift
 * (i.e. so the flow cannot be bypassed by calling the register API directly).
 *
 * Document rows are persisted as `VerificationResult` records with a
 * `DOCUMENT_<TYPE>` type and status "Uploaded" during onboarding.
