/**
 * POS settlement sweep — MIRROR-DRIVEN.
 *
 * The `PosTransactionMirror` read-model is now the single source of truth for
 * POS transactions (populated by the capture webhook + the reconciliation
 * sweep). Rather than pulling the partner API a SECOND time to feed settlement,
 * this sweep reads CAPTURED rows straight from our own DB and feeds each into
 * `handlePosCapture`, which prices MDR (brand rate card or the retailer's
 * unified Scheme), creates a PENDING/INSTANT settlement entry, and distributes
 * upline commission. The T+1 cron then settles PENDING entries on their capture
 * day; instant mode credits immediately.
 *
 * Only genuinely settleable captures are processed: we pre-resolve the set of
 * terminals that are (a) assigned to a retailer AND (b) whose retailer is ACTIVE
 * with an assigned scheme, then query the mirror for just those terminals.
 * `handlePosCapture`'s own gates (assigned / active / priceable) remain the
 * final safety net, so an unpriceable capture is surfaced as `noScheme` rather
 * than settled.
 *
 * Fully idempotent: `handlePosCapture` dedupes on the canonical `transactionRef`
 * (the mirror uses the SAME key), so overlapping/retried runs never double-book.
