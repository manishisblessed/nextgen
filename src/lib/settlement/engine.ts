/**
 * Shared settlement primitives for the acquiring rails (POS / PG / QR).
 *
 * The client model: a transaction lands UNSETTLED, and the retailer either
 * presses "Instant settle" (paid at the scheme's T0 rate) or lets the next-day
 * T+1 cron settle the rest (at the cheaper T1 rate). The "instant fee" is not a
 * separate charge — it is simply the scheme's T0 MDR (mdrValueT0), so the
 * effective premium for settling early = MDR(T0) − MDR(T1).
 *
 * The no-double-credit guarantee is enforced by every caller with the same
 * triple lock:
 *   1. a conditional status transition (PENDING/SETTLEABLE → SETTLED) claimed
 *      with updateMany BEFORE any credit — only one writer can win;
 *   2. a ledger idempotencyKey on the wallet credit — a racing writer's credit
 *      is refused even if it slips past the status gate;
 *   3. the T+1 cron only ever reads rows still awaiting settlement, so anything
 *      already instant-settled is invisible to it.
