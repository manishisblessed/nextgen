 * Async job queue (pg-boss, backed by Postgres — no extra infra on the EC2 box).

 * Why a queue: payment "hits" (BulkPe payout, BBPS, etc.) must NOT be processed
 * synchronously inside the HTTP request. The API enqueues a job and returns fast;
 * a separate worker process (PM2) drains the queue, calls the provider (from the
 * IP-whitelisted box), and finalizes via webhook/poll. This is what lets us
 * absorb bursts without exhausting the request thread pool or DB connections.
 *
 * The worker entrypoint (registered via `boss.work(...)`) lands in Phase 2.
