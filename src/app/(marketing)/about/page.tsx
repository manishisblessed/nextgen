              <p className="lead mt-5">
                NextGenPay started in a small office in Surat in 2025 with a
                stubborn belief — that the same financial services available to
                a Mumbai professional should be available to a kirana owner in
                Banswara, in seconds, in their language, at a fair price.
              </p>
              <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-ink-600">
                <p>
                  Our founders had spent years inside banks and payment networks
                  watching the same story play out: rails built for the top of
                  the pyramid, retrofitted for the bottom. Forms in English.
                  Settlements in days. Support in business hours. Hidden charges
                  buried in PDFs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We asked a simple question — what would a payments company
                  look like if it was designed, line by line, for the retailer
                  in a 2G village? We threw out the playbook and started from
                  the customer's counter.
                </p>

                  Today, that same Surat team powers AePS withdrawals, money
                  transfers, bill payments, recharges, travel bookings, payment
                  gateway, POS terminals and QR collections — all under one
                  login, one ledger and one phone number for support.
